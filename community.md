Technology thrives on shared learning.

Here’s how I contribute:
- Publishing technical articles and tutorials on secure automation
- Mentoring across disciplines — from students to practitioners
- Building open-source projects and inviting feedback from peers

Whether you're curious, experienced, or just starting out — there’s space here for you. Let’s build something resilient together.
