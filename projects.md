title: My Projects & Tools
---

Welcome to my site — I’m Ayomide, blending security, automation, and education to empower builders of resilient systems.  

Here are projects I've led or contributed to that embed security into development from the ground up:

## 🔑 Key Projects

### 🚀 Automated CI/CD for AWS Infrastructure  
**Tools:** Jenkins, GitHub Actions, Terraform  
Implemented secure, modular pipelines to provision and deploy infrastructure on AWS. Streamlined release workflows and increased reliability across environments by codifying cloud resources and embedding policy enforcement.

### ☸️ Kubernetes Orchestration with Self-Hosted Runners  
**Tools:** GitHub Actions, Kubernetes  
Orchestrated deployments using GitHub Actions and private runners. Scaled provisioning pipelines, improved automation consistency, and reduced latency in rollout processes.

### 📦 GitOps Delivery with Helm & ArgoCD  
**Tools:** Helm, ArgoCD, Kubernetes  
Delivered declarative application rollouts across microservices. Improved rollback precision and enabled progressive delivery in GitOps-aligned environments.

### 🧪 Multi-Service Container Pipelines  
**Tools:** Docker Compose, GitHub Actions  
Built and tested Docker pipelines to support reliable multi-container orchestration. Accelerated integration testing and enabled consistent deployment workflows.

### 🔐 IAM Governance via Terraform  
**Tools:** Terraform  
Designed reusable IAM modules to enforce least-privilege access across cloud workloads. Strengthened compliance alignment and simplified audit preparation.

### 🏗️ Three-Tier Web Architecture on AWS  
**Tools:** Terraform, AWS EC2, ALB  
Provisioned fault-tolerant, scalable web architectures including VPCs, EC2 instances, and ALBs. Enhanced application resilience and operational performance.

### 📊 Observability Stack for Real-Time Monitoring  
**Tools:** Prometheus, Grafana, Kubernetes  
Configured full-stack monitoring platforms to track resource metrics, alert anomalies, and reduce incident response time across containerised workloads.

### ⚙️ Hybrid Config Management Workflows  
**Tools:** Jenkins, GitHub Actions, Ansible  
Engineered workflows to support dynamic updates, multi-platform consistency, and low-risk rollback mechanisms.

### 🔍 Embedded DevSecOps in CI/CD  
**Tools:** CodeRabbit, SonarQube  
Integrated automated code scanning into pipelines to enforce security standards, detect vulnerabilities, and promote secure development practices.

### 🌐 Zero-Downtime Infrastructure Rollouts  
**Tools:** Terraform, Ansible  
Automated infrastructure deployment across mission-critical environments. Reduced errors, improved reproducibility, and achieved resilient rollout processes.

### 💻 EC2 Cluster Provisioning with ALB  
**Tools:** Terraform, AWS  
Deployed scalable EC2 clusters behind ALBs to optimise cost-efficiency, fault tolerance, and performance visibility.

### 🛎️ Custom Monitoring Scripts  
**Tools:** Bash  
Authored uptime checks for websites and APIs, reducing detection time and strengthening operational awareness across production services.


- 🔐 **CloudAuditGo** — an open-source tool for automated cloud compliance
- 🚀 **Secure CI/CD Pipelines** — GitHub Actions + Terraform + mutation testing
- 🧩 **Kubernetes Hardening Playbooks** — GitOps and SRE alignment

Each project reflects a commitment to making security usable, scalable, and audit-ready.
