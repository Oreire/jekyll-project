title: My Projects & Tools
---

Welcome to my site — I’m Ayomide, blending security, automation, and education to empower builders of resilient systems.  


Here are projects I've led or contributed to that embed security into development from the ground up:

- 🔐 **CloudAuditGo** — an open-source tool for automated cloud compliance
- 🚀 **Secure CI/CD Pipelines** — GitHub Actions + Terraform + mutation testing
- 🧩 **Kubernetes Hardening Playbooks** — GitOps and SRE alignment

Each project reflects a commitment to making security usable, scalable, and audit-ready.


My list of Projects are avilable on my GitHub Repositories. Feel free to persus and contact me for collaboration if required.
