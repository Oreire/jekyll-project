Welcome to my site — I’m Ayomide, blending security, automation, and education to empower builders of resilient systems.  

Here are projects I've led or contributed to that embed security into development from the ground up:

## 🔑 Key Projects

### 🚀 [Automated CI/CD for AWS Infrastructure](#automated-ci-cd-for-aws-infrastructure)  
Securely orchestrated cloud provisioning and deployment workflows using Jenkins, GitHub Actions, and Terraform. Achieved modular, repeatable infrastructure with policy enforcement and zero-touch deployments.

### ☸️ [Kubernetes Orchestration with Self-Hosted Runners](#kubernetes-orchestration-with-self-hosted-runners)  
Enhanced deployment scale and consistency by integrating GitHub Actions with self-hosted runners, reducing rollout latency and boosting operational control in Kubernetes environments.

### 📦 [GitOps Delivery with Helm & ArgoCD](#gitops-delivery-with-helm--argocd)  
Implemented declarative microservice rollouts using Helm charts and ArgoCD. Enabled progressive delivery and precise rollback for rapid iteration in containerised stacks.

### 🧪 [Multi-Service Container Pipelines](#multi-service-container-pipelines)  
Built Docker-based CI workflows to manage multi-container stacks with consistency. Accelerated testing feedback loops and simplified service orchestration.

### 🔐 [IAM Governance via Terraform](#iam-governance-via-terraform)  
Codified least-privilege access policies with modular Terraform code. Improved cloud security posture and compliance traceability across environments.

### 🏗️ [Three-Tier Web Architecture on AWS](#three-tier-web-architecture-on-aws)  
Provisioned scalable, fault-tolerant AWS architecture using Terraform. Delivered performance-tuned deployments for dynamic web applications.

### 📊 [Observability Stack for Real-Time Monitoring](#observability-stack-for-real-time-monitoring)  
Configured Prometheus and Grafana integrations for Kubernetes services. Enabled proactive diagnostics and reduced incident response time.

### ⚙️ [Hybrid Config Management Workflows](#hybrid-config-management-workflows)  
Engineered cross-platform automation using Jenkins, GitHub Actions, and Ansible. Improved update reliability, rollback safety, and operational consistency.

### 🔍 [Embedded DevSecOps in CI/CD](#embedded-devsecops-in-ci-cd)  
Integrated security tools such as CodeRabbit and SonarQube into CI pipelines. Automated code quality checks and vulnerability detection from the first commit.

### 🌐 [Zero-Downtime Infrastructure Rollouts](#zero-downtime-infrastructure-rollouts)  
Deployed mission-critical infrastructure using Terraform and Ansible. Achieved reproducible, zero-downtime rollouts with secure change management.

### 💻 [EC2 Cluster Provisioning with ALB](#ec2-cluster-provisioning-with-alb)  
Provisioned resilient EC2 clusters behind ALBs using Terraform. Balanced cost, reliability, and performance across high-traffic workloads.

### 🛎️ [Custom Monitoring Scripts](#custom-monitoring-scripts)  
Built Bash scripts to monitor uptime for web and API services. Reduced degradation detection time and improved operational observability.


Each project reflects a commitment to making security usable, scalable, and audit-ready.
