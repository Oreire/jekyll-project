title: Mentoring & Coaching
---

Mentoring is where technical mastery meets personal growth.

I help learners:
- Structure their professional stories using STAR and power-of-three
- Translate DevSecOps principles into confident interview narratives
- Grow into security-conscious collaborators across roles and domains

My coaching style is focused, kind, and action-oriented â€” because the next generation of secure engineers deserves clarity and confidence.
