Writing is how I turn systems thinking into shared insight.

Here you'll find:
- 📝 Posts on secure CI/CD practices using UK English and action phrasing
- 📘 Deep dives on CloudAuditGo and DevOps culture transformation
- 🧠 Reflections on psychological safety, SRE, and chaos engineering

Each article aims to clarify the complex, challenge convention, and empower others to build securely with confidence.
